1. Problem: 
    1.1. operators: []
    1.2. initial state: (position of ship, number of people alive, number of boxes not destroyed, ) -> randomly generated
    1.3. State space: 

        number of rescued passengers
        number of retrieved boxes
        coast guard: capacity, max capacity, position (x,y)
        grid - m*n matrix
            cells:
                type of cell [station, ship, empty]
                if ship: number of passengers, box health

    1.4. Goal test: if current state:
        1. grid has no ships containing alive passengers or undamaged boxes; AND
        2. the coast guard has no passengers onboard

    1.5. path cost function: 
        at time step t: (num of deaths, num of boxes to be lost)
        weight of deaths is BIGGER: 1 death = m*n*2, 1 box lost = 1
